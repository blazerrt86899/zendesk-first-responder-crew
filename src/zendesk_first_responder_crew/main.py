    Hi @Lokhande, Abhijeet 

Hope you're doing well.

We had earlier installed both network plugins (VPC-CNI and Calico) in your EKS clusters. However, weâ€™ve observed that VPC-CNI is currently not being utilized. We would appreciate your support in migrating the cluster to use VPC-CNI as the primary CNI.

Looking forward to your guidance.

 

Thanks

    Hi Team,

Please find the details of the following security alert that our SOC detected:

This alert was triggered when SIEM detected a potential PHP File Inclusion attack attempt.

Security Alerts Details:

Start Time: March 28, 2025, 11:32 PM (IST)
Source IP Address: 165.22.215.131
Host: 43.205.154.2
URI: /hello.world
HTTP Method: POST
Action: Allow
Source IP Analysis:

165.22.215.131

ISP: DigitalOcean, LLC
Country: India
IP Reputation: Poor
 

SOC Analyst Triage Comments:

SIEM detected a suspicious post request from the source IP address 165.22.215.131, which contains the following arguments:
"allow_url_include=1": Enables remote file inclusion, allowing external scripts to be executed via URL.
"auto_prepend_file=php://input": Forces PHP to execute code from the raw POST body, enabling code injection.
Furthermore, the post request was allowed by the Web Application Firewall "Truthscreen-Prod".
Additionally, the user-agent in the post request was "Custom-AsyncHttpClient", which is not a typical browser and might indicate the use of an automated script or scanning tool.
On analyzing the logs, we have seen multiple Get requests for suspicious URI from the above-mentioned source IP address to the same host in the past 3 hours, and all of those requests were allowed by the web application firewall. For more information, refer to the box link mentioned below:
Box-Link: https://app.box.com/s/bqetmdquwwmtryp14ht0cdcv3qai34ev
 

Verification Required:

Could you please verify this activity and let us know if it is legitimate or not?
If not legitimate, then please follow the below-mentioned recommended next steps:
Recommended Next Steps:

Block or rate-limit the above-mentioned source IP address if it's not a recognized or legitimate user.
Update WAF rules to block suspicious parameters like allow_url_include and php://input.
Disable risky PHP directives (allow_url_include, auto_prepend_file) and apply open_basedir restrictions in production.
